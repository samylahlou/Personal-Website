            <h3> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Transition-Advanced-Mathematics-Douglas-Smith/dp/0534340288">A Transition to Advanced Mathematics (4th Edition)</a></h3>
            <p> A Transition to Advanced Mathematics by Douglas Smith, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.trinity.edu/directory/meggen">Maurice Eggen</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cmich.edu/people/RICHARD-J-ST-ANDRE">Richard St. Andre</a> is the perfect book to get into pure mathematics and rigorous proofs after taking the usual calculus classes. The book is structured in a way that gives a very large and clear overview of what mathematics really are. Moreover, since there is a big focus on proofs, every single theorem can be proved using what was already proved in the book, in other words, the book is completely self-contained. I discovered in this book the satisfaction of proving every single steps leading to a theorem. <br>
            I find the content really interesting. The book starts with a chapter on Logic which was surprising but turned out to be extremely important. I was amazed by the power of the tools presented in this chapter. The second chapter is on Set Theory (more precisely, what we now call <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory">Naive Set Theory</a> ). The notion of axioms and natural numbers are discussed. The third chapter discussed the notion of relations, equivalence relations and orderings. Before this chapter, I had strictly no idea what a relation was and I was afraid that the chapter would be boring. The chapter turned out to be really interesting as well as all of the other chapters. The transition from Chapter 3 to Chapter 4 was very smooth considering functions as a special case of relations. Chapter 5 explores rigorously the notion of cardinality, I personaly found this chapter to be the hardest, but still, an amazing chapter with very deep content (from the point of view of a complete beginner in pure mathematics). Finaly, the books perfectly ends with a sixth chapter on Group Theory (which opens the doors of abstract algebra) and a seventh chapter on Analysis (which opens the doors of Real Analysis). <br>
            This book has a lot of exercises and most of them really require to sit and think as hard as you can. This was my first time spending this much time on a single exercise, and I think that completing all of them really prepared me for my first pure mathematics classes. If I have time, I should probably write my solutions in LaTeX and put them in the <a href="solutions.html">Textbook Solutions</a> page of this website.</p> <br>
