        <h3>Why posting Textbook Solutions ?</h3>
        <p> It seems like posting the solutions to some textbook problems may not be the best idea since it will benefit the student who don't want to sprend too much time on a homework. However, I strongly think that such solutions will mostly benefit the student who solved an exercise but still wants to learn more by looking at different ways of approaching the problem. This relies on the fact that my solutions are in no way absolute, these are my personal solutions and it is important to keep in mind that solutions to a problem are not unique. Again, I really think that the best way to benefit from these solutions is to, first, solve the problem, and then look at the solutions.</p> <br>
