        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in the Faculty of Science at McGill University since 2022. I study Mathematics (<a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/undergraduate/programs/b-sc/honours-mathematics-b-sc">Honors</a>) and Computer Science (<a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-minor-computer-science">Minor</a>). I have been passionate about mathematics for a few years now, and this passion has only grown more important with time.</p> <br>

        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <p> My goal with this website is to share my work related to Mathematics. In the <a href="paper.html">Papers</a> Section, you can find the papers I have written for personal interests or for course projects. In the <a href="readings.html">Readings</a> Section, you can find my personal reviews of the math-related books that I have read and enjoyed the most. Finally, in the <a href="solutions.html">Textbook Solutions</a> Section, you can find my personal solutions to math-textbook exercises. <br> I am really grateful to <a href="https://github.com/zhaoshenzhai">Zhaoshen Zhai</a> and   <a href="https://louismeunier.net/">Louis Meunier</a> for inspiring me to create this website. I am also very grateful to Nisrine Sqalli for helping me throughout the entire process of creation this website. </p> <br>

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>For the moment, I am still learning the basics but I am really interested in focusing more on problems in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory">Analytic Number Theory</a> in the future. Beside Number Theory, I really liked learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">Set Theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory">Model Theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory">Computability Theory</a> and I hope to go deeper into these subjects in the near future. </p> <br>
