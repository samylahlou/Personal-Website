The main object in the theorem is the infinite sum of the reciprocals of the natural numbers. How do we make sense of adding infinitely many numbers together ? What do we mean by an expression of the form
$$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + ...$$
or 
$$1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ...$$
which don't have an obvious interpretation. To make sense of such expressions, we need to define the notion of $\textit{convergence}$ which is the main concept behind the theorem. In this paper, we will focus on the notion of convergence for sequences of real numbers.

\begin{definition}[Convergence of sequences]
    Given a sequence $(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...)$ of real numbers, we say that the sequence converges if there exists a real number $L$ such that the sequence gets arbitrarily close to $L$. To make it more precise, this is equivalent to saying that for any distance $\epsilon > 0$, there is an index $N \in \N$ such that every term of the sequence with index bigger than $N$ is at a distance less than $\epsilon$ from $L$:
    $$|a_n - L| < \epsilon$$
    for all $n \geq N$. If such a real number $L$ exists, we write 
    $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n = L$$
\end{definition}

The notion of convergence is the key to understand such infinite sums because intuitively, we interpret 
$$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16}  + ...$$
as summing $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{4}$, ... succesively and at each step computing the finite sum. In this example, we get

\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{2} &= 0.5 \\
    \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} &= 0.75 \\
    \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} &= 0.875 \\
    \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} &= 0.9375 \\
\end{align*}

If we continue this process, we may notice that the result at each step gets closer and closer to the 1. Hence, we may write
$$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + ... = 1$$
Using the notion of convergence for sequences, we can now define infinite sums more rigorously.

\begin{definition}
    Given a sequence $(a_n)_{n=1,2,...}$, we define the new sequence $(s_n)_{n=1,2,...}$ as the sequence of partial sums of $(a_n)_n$:
    $$s_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n}a_k = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n$$
    If the new sequence $(s_n)_n$ converges to a real number $L$, then we write
    $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n = L$$
    and say that the series associated with $(a_n)_n$ converges to $L$. If the sequence $(s_n)_n$ don't converge, then we say that the series associated to $(a_n)_n$ diverges.
\end{definition}

Hence, with our last example, saying that
$$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + ... = 1$$
Actually means that the sequence $(0.5, \ 0.75, \ 0.875, \ 0.9375, \ ...)$ gets closer and closer to 1, which makes sense (since it turns out to be true) and gives a more precise definition for infinite sums. However, if we take our other example of infinite sum which was
$$1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ...$$
then the sequence of partial sums is $(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ...)$ which isn't convergent since it don't get closer to any real number. Therefore, we have that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{k+1}$ diverges. \\

If we look back to our goal, which is proving the theorem, we now understand that we need to study the limit of the sequence of partial sums of the sequence $(\frac{1}{n})_n$. Hence, we need to prove that
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} = \infty$$
However, we never defined what it means to converge to infinity, we only defined what it means to converge to a real number.

\begin{definition}
    Given a sequence $(a_n)_n$ of real numbers, we say that
    $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n = \infty$$
    if the sequence of partial sums gets arbitrarily large at a certain point. More precisely, if for all $M \geq 0$, there exists an index $N \in \N$ such that the partial sums $s_n$ are greater than $M$ for all $n \geq N$.
\end{definition}

It turns out that to prove $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} = \infty$, it suffices to show that the series diverges. We will prove this fact in the next section.

With these three definitions, we now know exactly what we need to prove, we need to show that the sequence $(1, 1 + \frac{1}{2}, 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}, ...)$ gets arbitrarily large. We are now ready to prove some preliminary results that will make our proof easy and rigorous enough.
