\begin{exercise}
    Suppose that $D \in \L(\P_3(\R), \P_2(\R))$ is the differentiation map defined by $Dp = p'$. Find a basis of $\P_3(\R)$ and a basis of $\P_2(\R)$ such that the matrix of $D$ with respect to these bases is
    $$\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix}$$
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    \\ Consider the the basis $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$ of $\P_3(\R)$ and $q_0, q_1, q_2$ of $\P_2(\R)$ defined by 
    $$p_0(x) = x, \qquad p_1(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2, \qquad p_2(x) = \frac{1}{6}x^3, \qquad p_3(x) = 1$$
    and
    $$q_0(x) = 1, \qquad q_1(x) = x, \qquad q_2(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2.$$
    Since each of these lists have the right amount of elements and the polynomials have distinct degrees, then the lists are indeed bases. Now, let's compute the matrix of $D$ with respect to these bases. For the first column, since $Dp_0 = 1 = q_0 = 1\cdot q_0 + 0 \cdot q_1 + 0\cdot q_2$, then the first column is
    $$\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & * & * & * \\ 0 & * & * & * \\ 0 & * & * & * 
    \end{pmatrix}.$$
    For the second column, we have $Dp_1 = x = q_1 = 0\cdot q_0 + 1 \cdot q_1 + 0\cdot q_2$. This gives us
    $$\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & * & * \\ 0 & 1 & * & * \\ 0 & 0 & * & * 
    \end{pmatrix}.$$
    For the third column, we have $Dp_2 = \frac{1}{2}x^2 = q_2 = 0\cdot q_0 + 0 \cdot q_1 + 1\cdot q_2$. This gives us
    $$\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & * \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & * 
    \end{pmatrix}.$$
    Finally, since $Dp_3 = 0 =  0\cdot q_0 + 0 \cdot q_1 + 0\cdot q_2$, then our matrix is 
    $$\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix}.$$\\
