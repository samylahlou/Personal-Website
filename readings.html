        <h2>Textbooks in Mathematics</h2>
        
        <br> <p>The following books are textbooks that I really enjoyed reading. For each of them, I give a precise review with some informations that would probably be useful for anyone who wants to learn more about a specific subject. Each of the following helped me a lot and made me discover some wonderful theorems and concepts. I will probably add more books to this section in the next months.</p> <br>

        <br> <p>In the previous section, I present the textbooks that helped me and that are worth sharing as much as possible. In this section, I keep this same idea but for books that are not textbooks. Some of them may be about the History of Mathematics and others about Mathematics in general. Again, this is not the list of the books that I read but the list of books that are worth sharing with others (in my personal opinion). I will probably add more books to this section in the next months.</p> <br>
