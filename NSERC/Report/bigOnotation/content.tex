\chapter{The Big-O Notation} \label{chap:bigOnotation}

I learned everything from the book \textit{Discrete Math and Its Applications} at \cite{rosen2019discrete}.

\begin{definition}
    If $f$ and $g$ are real-valued functions such that
    $$|f(x)| \leq C|g(x)|$$
    for some positive constants $C$ and for all $x > k$ where $k > 0$, then we say that $f$ is $O(g)$. 
\end{definition}
