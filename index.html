        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in the Faculty of Science at McGill University since 2022. I study Mathematics (Honors) and Computer Science (Minor). My goal with this website is to share my work related to Mathematics: This includes the papers I write, the presentations I give, my reviews to the books that I read and my solutions to the exercises I find in textbooks.</p> <br>

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>For the moment, I am still learning the basics but I am really interested in focusing more on problems in Analytic Number Theory in the futur. Beside Number Theory, I really liked learning about Set Theory, Model Theory and Computation Theory and I would be really interested in diving more deeply into these subjects in the near futur. </p>
