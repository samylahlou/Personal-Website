        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in the Faculty of Science at McGill University since 2022. I study Mathematics (<a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/undergraduate/programs/b-sc/honours-mathematics-b-sc">Honors</a>). I have been passionate about mathematics for a few years now, and this passion has only grown more important with time. <br> My main current project is the writing of a document (potentially a book) on the detailed history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-function">L-functions</a>. I began this project in the summer of 2025 as a funded research project under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.math.mcgill.ca/darmon/">Henri Darmon</a>. </p> <br>

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>For the moment, I am still learning the basics but I am particularly interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory">Analytic Number Theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number_theory">Algebraic Number Theory</a>, more precisely, special values of L-functions and their link with other mathematical objects such as elliptic curves and modular forms. I also really liked learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">Set Theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory">Model Theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory">Computability Theory</a> and I hope to go deeper into these subjects in the near future. </p> <br>

        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1rem">
            <li> <p>My goal with this website is to share my work related to Mathematics. In the <a href="paper.html">Papers</a> Section, you can find the papers I have written for personal interests or for course projects. In the <a href="readings.html">Readings</a> Section, you can find my personal reviews of the math-related books that I have read and enjoyed the most. Finally, in the <a href="solutions.html">Textbook Solutions</a> Section, you can find my personal solutions to math-textbook exercises.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>I am planning on adding a few other sections on this website. I will probably soon add a Notes section where I would upload my lecture notes for some selected courses, and the notes I wrote when I was the Teaching Assistant for the course History & Phiosophy of Mathematics (MATH 338). I also want to add an iteractive section dedicated to new and fun ways of plotting graphs of real functions. Finally, I want to add a section on my music projects related to Mathematics, in particular, a project I am working on which is related to oscilloscope music.</p>
