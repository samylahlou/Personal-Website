\maketitle

These notes are based on lectures given by Professor Henri Darmon at McGill University in Winter 2025. The subject of these lectures is Representation Theory and Galois Theory but I chose to take notes only for the Galois Theory part. \\
As a disclaimer, it is more than possible that I made some mistakes. Feel free to correct me or ask me anything about the content of this document at the following address : samy.lahloukamal@mcgill.ca

\section{Fields Extensions}

\begin{definition}[Field Extension]
    If and $\E$ and $\F$ are fields, we say that $E$ is an extension of $F$ if $F$ is a subfield of $E$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    If $\E$ is an extension of $\F$, then $\E$ is also a vector space over $\F$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    Given a fields $\E$ and $\F$ and $\alpha \in \E$ where $\E$ is an extension of $\F$, we denote by $\F[\alpha]$ the ring generated by $\F$ and $\alpha$, i.e., $\F[\alpha]$ is the intersection of all the fields containing both $\F$ and $\alpha$. Similarly, we denote by $\F(\alpha)$ the field generated by $\F$ and $\alpha$.\\
    Hence, there is a natural inclusion from $\F[\alpha]$ to $\F(\alpha)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    The degree of $\E$ over $\F$ is the dimension of $\E$ as a $\F$ vector space. It is written as $[\E:\F]$. If the degree is finite, we say that $\E/\F$ is finite.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    \item $[\C : \R] = 2$ since $\R \subset \C$ and $\C$ is a 2-dimensional $\R$-vector space.
    \item $[\C : \Q] = \infty$ since $\Q \subset \C$ and $\C$ is an $\infty$-dimensional $\Q$-vector space. Using the Axiom of Choice, we can construct a basis for this vector space, it is called the Hamel basis.
    \item Let $\F$ be a field and $\E = \F[x]/(p)$ where $p$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$, then 
    $$\E = \{a_0 + a_1x + ... + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}\}$$
    so $[\E : \F] = n$ since $\E$ contains $\F$ (the constant polynomials) and has basis $\{1, x, ..., x^{n-1}\}$.
    \item Let $\F$ be a field and $\E = \F(x)$ be the fraction field of $\F[x]$, then $[\E : \F] = \infty$.
    \item Given an irreducible polynomial $p$ over $\Q$ and a root $\alpha$ of $p$, then 
    $$\Q[\alpha] = \Q(\alpha) = \Q[x] /(p)$$
    is an extension of $\Q$ of degree $\deg p$. The isomorphism $\Q(\alpha) \isomorphic \Q[x] /(p)$ comes from the valuation map $ev_\alpha : \Q[x] /(p) \to \Q(\alpha)$.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[Multiplicativity of the degree]
    Given three fields $\K \subset \F \subset \E$, we have
    $$[\E : \K] = [\E : \F] [\F : \K].$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    If one of the degree is infinite, the proof is trivial, hence, assume that the degrees are finite. Call $[\E : \F] = n$ and $[\F : \K] = m$. Let $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n \in \F$ be a basis for $\E$ as a $\F$-vector space and $\beta_1, ..., \beta_m \in \K$ be a basis for $\F$ as a $\K$-vector space. Notice that for all $a \in \E$, there exist elements $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n \in \F$ such that
    $$a = \lambda_1 \alpha_1  + ... + \lambda_n \alpha_n$$
    is the unique representation of $a$ as a linear combination of the basis $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n$. But for each $\lambda_i$, we know that there exist elements $\lambda_{i1}, ..., \lambda_{im} \in \K$ such that 
    $$\lambda_i = \lambda_{i1}\beta_1 + ... + \lambda_{im}\beta_m$$. Thus,
    $$a = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{m}\lambda_{ij}\alpha_i \beta_j.$$
    Therefore, $\{\alpha_i \beta_j\}_{i,j}$ is a $\K$ basis for $\E$. Hence, it follows that the dimension of $\E$ as $K$-vector space is $n\cdot m$.
\end{proof}

\section{Ruler and Compass Constructions}

\begin{definition}
    A complex number is constructible by ruler and compass if it can be obtained from rational numbers by successive applications of field operations (+, -, $\times$, division) and square roots.
\end{definition}

The set of elements constructible by ruler and compass is an extension of $\Q$ of infinite degree. The goal is to characterize the set of numbers which can be constructible by ruler and compass.

\begin{theorem}
    If $\alpha \in \R$ is a root of an irreducible cubic polynomial over $\Q$, then $\alpha$ is not constructible by ruler and compass.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $\alpha$ is constructible, then there are finite field extensions 
    $$\Q \subset \F_1 \subset ... \subset \F_n$$
    with $\F_{i+1} = \F_i(\sqrt{a_i})$ for some $a_i \in \F_i$. Hence, for all $i$, we have that $[F_{i+1} : F_i]$ since $\{1, \sqrt{a_i}\}$ is a basis for $F_{i+1}$ as a $\F_i$-vector space. Thus, by multiplicativity of the degree, $[\F_n : \Q] = 2^n$. Moreover, we know that $[\Q(\alpha) : \Q] = 3$ so we get the following diagram : \td. Contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    \item (Duplicating the cube) $p(x) = x^3 - 2$ and $\alpha = \sqrt[3]{2}$ cannot be constructible.
    \item (Trissection of angle) $p(x) = x^3 - 3x + \frac{1}{2}$ and $\alpha = \cos(2\pi/9)$:
    $$\cos(3\theta) = \cos^3 \theta - 3\cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2\theta)$$
\end{example}
