        <br> <p> In this section, I present and review the books on Mathematics that I have enjoyed reading (or not). For each of them, I give general informations about the book, a description, a review, the prerequisites for the book, and some recommendation for further readings. This is for people who might want to read any the books mentioned here. I will probably add more books to this section in the next months.</p> <br>

        <br> <p>The following books are textbooks that I enjoyed reading (or not). In the same way as for the previous books, I give a precise review and some informations for each of them that would probably be useful for anyone who wants to learn more about a specific subject.
