\section{Vector Space of Linear Maps}

\begin{exercise}
    Suppose $b,c \in \R$. Define $T: \R^3 \to \R^2$ by
    $$T(x,y,z) = (2x-4y + 3z + b, 6x + cxyz).$$
    Show that $T$ is linear if and only if $b = c = 0$. \\
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    \\ ($\implies$) Suppose that $T$ is linear, then we know from Proposition 3.10 that $T0 = 0$. Thus, it follows that
    $$T(0,0,0) = (b, 0) = (0,0)$$
    which implies that $b = 0$. To prove that $c = 0$, notice that by linearity of $T$, we have
    $$T(2,2,2) = 2T(1,1,1).$$
    If we plug-in the values into the definition of $T$, we get
    $$T$$
